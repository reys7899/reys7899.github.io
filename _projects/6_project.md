    3D Fractals
</div>

- Built a **C library** for in-memory data structures representing 3D scenes utilizing **nested structs**
- Implemented functions for saving and writing 3D scenes to STL files in text and binary formats
- Provided tools for appending fractals, pyramids, spheres, and other shapes to the scenes
